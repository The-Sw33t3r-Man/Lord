        <h2 style="font-size: 30px; color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">Introduction</h2> 


        <p> Mercedes-Benz introduced the seventh-generation S-Class luxury sedan for 2021. For the 2022 model year, it adds an even more luxurious Maybach model, with an available twin-turbo V-12 engine in addition to a twin-turbo V-8. The regular S-Class competes against BMW 7 Series, Audi A8, Lexus LS, Genesis G90, and Tesla Model S while the Maybach S-Class variants straddle the upper echelons of the full-size luxury sedan segment and the ultra-luxe tier occupied by Bentley and Rolls-Royce.

            Traditionally, the S-Class has been the benchmark for the luxury full-size sedan segment.
            It deserves to retain this reputation as Mercedes-Benz nailed the execution on the latest installment of its gas-powered flagship (read about the EQS-Class electric flagship here).
            All variants of the S-Class are stuffed with cutting-edge technology, including Level 2 semi-autonomous driving capabilities, augmented-reality navigation, and a 3-D gauge cluster. These features are integrated into the driving experience seamlessly.
            Mercedes didn't let the S-Class' driving dynamics fall by the wayside while cramming all that tech into its flagship, either.
            This full-size luxury sedan exhibits excellent on-road poise and treats occupants to a comfortable ride.
            Aside from having what could possibly be too much tech for some folks, the only other downside to the S-Class is its segment-topping starting price.
            
            The 2022 Mercedes-Maybach S-Class variants exhibit all these great characteristics while adding flair to the exterior styling and unique touches to the interior. It has a lot of bling, but it also delivers in all the departments needed for a luxury vehicle at its price point. Speaking of price, the Maybach sedans represent somewhat of a good deal in the ultra-luxury world. The top-spec S680 starts at less than half the price of the Rolls-Royce Phantom while still exuding the glitz its target buyers expect.</p>
